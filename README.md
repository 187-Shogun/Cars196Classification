### Cars196 Classification Model

This project implements a basic Tensorflow model using convolutional layers in order to classify car images. The possible classes are 196 different manufacturers.

### Instructions:

Simply run the main.py file and wait till it returns a zero code. The script downloads a dataset, preprocess it and then use it tp train a neural network model. Once that is ready, it saves the model in H5 format and the training results on a logs folder. The logs folder can be accessed using the tensorboard UI.

### Env Requirements:

Python 3.9\
Use pip install -r ./requirements.txt
